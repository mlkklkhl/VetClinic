## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- MySQL

### Initialize project
```
npm init -y
```

### Install dependencies
#### For your vet clinic project, youâ€™ll need [express] for the server and [mysql] for database connectivity.
#### You may also want to use [body-parser] to parse incoming request bodies.
```npm install express mysql2 body-parser multer cors```

#### (Optional) Install nodemon for development
#### To make development easier, you can install [nodemon], which automatically restarts your server when file changes are detected
```
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

#### Update package.json for nodemon
#### Manually edit package.json to include "dev" script
```
"scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "dev": "nodemon server.js"
}
```

### Start server
```
npm run dev
```
